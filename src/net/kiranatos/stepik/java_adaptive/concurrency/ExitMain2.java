Java allows you to provide the custom ThreadFactory to the executor to be used 
to construct the pool's threads, by setting the corresponding thread's 
properties.
Make the corresponding change in the program below to allow the program to 
terminate even if not all the threads are completed (or if they are completed).
Hint: remember the difference between daemon and non-daemon thread.
